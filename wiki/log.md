## [2026-05-10 | workspace | wiki audit against idle-tower]

**Touched pages:** none in wiki body; added top-level `AGENTS.md`, reduced `CLAUDE.md` to a pointer.
**Added:** top-level `AGENTS.md` matching idle-tower's convention (project notes + pointer to wiki).
**Updated:** `CLAUDE.md` now defers to `AGENTS.md`.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none.
**Audit notes:** schema (frontmatter, log format, page conventions, filenames) matches idle-tower's `wiki/AGENTS.md`. Directory layout is an intentional subset — flux omits `trails/` and `playbooks/`, consistent with "do not create pages speculatively". `kind` enum is narrower (no `experiment`, `trail`, `playbook`); fine until those page types are needed.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | one flow per edge]

**Touched pages:** [[one-flow-per-edge]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[index]]
**Added:** [[one-flow-per-edge]] decision capturing the new `applyAction` rule that at most one flow may exist per undirected edge, with reverse-as-flip semantics.
**Updated:** [[continuous-flow-model]] to reference the new per-edge constraint; [[index]] route map.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none.

## [2026-05-10 | bootstrap | seed flux]

**Touched pages:** [[flux]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[pure-step-function]] [[galcon-like]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** initial wiki schema, route map, entity page, two decision pages, genre topic page; open question recording the dumb-AI stalemate observed in `npm run sim`.
**Updated:** none.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** dumb AI stalemates against itself.
