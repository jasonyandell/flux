## [2026-05-10 | workspace | stasis detection]

**Touched pages:** [[decisions/stasis-detection]] [[entities/flux]] [[index]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** [[decisions/stasis-detection]] documenting the variance-window detector (`STASIS_SAMPLE_PERIOD_TICKS = 5`, `STASIS_WINDOW = 50`, `STASIS_EPSILON = 1.0`), the pure `detectStasis` in `src/sim/stasis.ts`, and the `showStasisBanner` sibling in `src/render/gameui.ts`. `src/main.ts` now keeps a ring buffer of per-player cell counts and freezes `step`/AI when stasis fires; `respawn()` resets the flag and buffer.
**Updated:** [[entities/flux]] lists `src/sim/stasis.ts` in the implementation frontier; [[index]] adds the decision; [[questions/open]] links to it as a mitigation for the four-AI stalemate.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none new.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | record neuroevolution as the planned next step]

**Touched pages:** [[topics/neuroevolution]] [[questions/open]] [[index]] [[entities/flux]]
**Added:** [[topics/neuroevolution]] capturing the rtNEAT direction — Stanley/Bryant/Miikkulainen lineage, NERO precedent, OpenNERO, controller shape (per-cell shared network, ~91→32→19 dense), evolution loop, four effort tiers, open implementation questions.
**Updated:** [[questions/open]] now points at [[topics/neuroevolution]] as the planned answer to the AI stalemate; [[index]] adds the topic; [[entities/flux]] mentions it as the next step.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none new; the existing stalemate question now has a planned answer rather than just possible directions.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | ai zoo + multi-player spectator]

**Touched pages:** [[decisions/ai-zoo]] [[decisions/multi-player-free-for-all]] [[entities/flux]] [[index]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** [[decisions/ai-zoo]] documenting six pure heuristics (`aggressive`, `random`, `defensive`, `greedy-neutral`, `opportunist`, `cluster`) under `src/ai/` with shared `utils.ts`/`rng.ts` and an `index.ts` registry, plus the sim `pair` and `tournament` subcommands. [[decisions/multi-player-free-for-all]] documenting the spectator-mode pivot: 2/4/6/8/12 perimeter-spaced AI seats, no human, wheel zoom only, `SPEED = 5` scaler. `REGEN_PER_SEC` bumped from 1.0 to 1.1 for pacing.
**Updated:** [[entities/flux]] rewritten to describe the multi-player spectator mode, the AI zoo, the 12-color palette, and the `SPEED` scaler; [[index]] adds the two new decision pages; [[questions/open]] narrows the AI stalemate to the four-AI "weakest-local-neighbor" attractor.
**Retired:** `src/ai/dumb.ts` (renamed to `src/ai/aggressive.ts`).
**Questions opened:** none new. Tournament confirmed defensive/opportunist lose to all four "active" heuristics, which stalemate against each other on the 1000-cell board.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | attack bonus replaces loop bonus]

**Touched pages:** [[attack-bonus]] [[loop-bonus]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[index]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** [[attack-bonus]] decision page; `ATTACK_BONUS = 0.5` constant in `state.ts`; non-friendly destination multiplier in `step.ts`. Friendly transfer is back to a wash.
**Updated:** [[continuous-flow-model]] now references [[attack-bonus]] instead of loop bonus; [[index]] route map; [[questions/open]] notes the stalemate persists even with combat acceleration — confirming the failure mode is the heuristic, not the combat constants.
**Retired:** [[loop-bonus]] (status: retired; one-line pointer to [[attack-bonus]]).
**Questions opened:** none new.
**Verification:** by hand. One-sided attack: attacker drains at 2/sec (regen 1 − k 3); passive defender drains at 3.5/sec (regen 1 − k·1.5 = 4.5). Mutual fire: both drain at 6.5/sec (regen 1 − k 3 source − k·1.5 inbound). Sim outcome: still 5/5 draws — the symmetric mirror match isn't broken by combat acceleration alone.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | loop bonus on friendly flows]

**Touched pages:** [[loop-bonus]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[index]]
**Added:** [[loop-bonus]] decision page; `LOOP_BONUS = 0.5` constant in `state.ts`; friendly-destination multiplier in `step.ts`.
**Updated:** [[continuous-flow-model]] now describes the friendly-destination multiplier and backlinks to [[loop-bonus]]; [[index]] route map.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none new. Stalemate sim outcome unchanged — dumb AI doesn't build chains, so the bonus has no effect under it.
**Verification:** by hand from constants. 3-cycle of friendly-owned cells with three active flows nets `+2.5·dt` per node per tick versus idle baseline of `+1.0·dt` — circulation now grows 2.5× faster than idle.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | hex grid default + instanced renderer]

**Touched pages:** [[hex-grid-default]] [[flux]] [[index]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** [[hex-grid-default]] decision page covering the new ~1000-cell hex board, renderer batching, the `WeakMap`-backed adjacency cache in `applyAction`, and the per-call adjacency list in `aiThink`.
**Updated:** [[flux]] reflects the hex board, instanced renderer, drag-input model, and slower-per-run sim; [[index]] route map; [[questions/open]] notes the stalemate persists at hex scale.
**Retired:** none. Old 7-node hand-laid graph is gone but lives in git.
**Questions opened:** none new. Browser was not tested from this session — flagged in commit.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | wiki audit against idle-tower]

**Touched pages:** none in wiki body; added top-level `AGENTS.md`, reduced `CLAUDE.md` to a pointer.
**Added:** top-level `AGENTS.md` matching idle-tower's convention (project notes + pointer to wiki).
**Updated:** `CLAUDE.md` now defers to `AGENTS.md`.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none.
**Audit notes:** schema (frontmatter, log format, page conventions, filenames) matches idle-tower's `wiki/AGENTS.md`. Directory layout is an intentional subset — flux omits `trails/` and `playbooks/`, consistent with "do not create pages speculatively". `kind` enum is narrower (no `experiment`, `trail`, `playbook`); fine until those page types are needed.

## [2026-05-10 | workspace | one flow per edge]

**Touched pages:** [[one-flow-per-edge]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[index]]
**Added:** [[one-flow-per-edge]] decision capturing the new `applyAction` rule that at most one flow may exist per undirected edge, with reverse-as-flip semantics.
**Updated:** [[continuous-flow-model]] to reference the new per-edge constraint; [[index]] route map.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** none.

## [2026-05-10 | bootstrap | seed flux]

**Touched pages:** [[flux]] [[continuous-flow-model]] [[pure-step-function]] [[galcon-like]] [[questions/open]]
**Added:** initial wiki schema, route map, entity page, two decision pages, genre topic page; open question recording the dumb-AI stalemate observed in `npm run sim`.
**Updated:** none.
**Retired:** none.
**Questions opened:** dumb AI stalemates against itself.
